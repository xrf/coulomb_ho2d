# Coulomb HO2D [![Build status][ci]][ca]

**Quick links:** [documentation][dc], [releases][rl].

Calculation of Coulomb interaction matrix elements in the basis of a
two-dimensional harmonic oscillator (HO2D).

## Installation

Download and unpack the [latest release][rl], then run:

    make PREFIX=/usr/local install

Replace `/usr/local` with wherever you want it to be installed.

## Mathematical details

The code calculates the spatial part of the Coulomb interaction matrix
element:

![matrix element][me]

Here, `Ï†[n, ml]` denotes the eigenfunction of a two-dimensional harmonic
oscillator with principal quantum number `n` and angular momentum projection
`ml`.  In polar coordinates, these functions may be defined in terms of the
[associated Laguerre polynomials][lp] `L`:

## Implementations

The library is designed to be extensible: calculation of the the matrix
elements is fulfilled via a *tabulation provider*, a specialized executable
that understands a certain file format and protocol.  For details, see
`protocol.h` and `clh2-am.c`.

The library has a default provider called `clh2-am` that is installed with the
package.  This provider use the analytic formula in
[Anisimovas & Matulis (1998)][am], which yields a relatively simple
implementation with no external dependencies.  However, it can be quite slow
and may be inaccurate for higher shells.  You can substitute another provider
easily by setting the `provider` argument when calling `clh2_request`.

If you'd like, you can install a different provider: [clh2-openfci][co], which
can be much faster and more accurate than the default provider.
